        <h2>Typing Master</h2>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>
            A typing test is designed to find how fast one types in a given amount of time. We will design a typing game using JavaScript that presents a simple typing challenge and finds the performance of typing by calculating the Characters Per Minute (CPM), Words Per Minute (WPM), and the accuracy of the typed characters. The game shows a series of quotes that have to be typed in a specified time limit, as fast as possible. A higher typing speed would show a higher WPM value. Incorrectly typed characters would be marked accordingly during typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will create the HTML layout first, style it using CSS, and then write the logic in JavaScript.

        <h2>Car Racing</h2>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>
            Games have changed, but the concept is the same:
            <ul>
                <li>Know how to handle your car</li>
                <li>Use a comfortable controller</li>
                <li>Know the type of racing game you're playing</li>
                <li>Keep racing lines clean and tight</li>
                <li>Use drifting sparingly</li>
                <li>Brake properly</li>
                <li>Draft other racers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Menja</h2>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>
            In the game, the player must throw dice into the air by swiping the device's touch screen with their finger(s), or in the case of the Xbox 360 version, the player's arms and hands, and must not slice bombs. It features multiple gameplay modes.
